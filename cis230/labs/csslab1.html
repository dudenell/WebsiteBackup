		<h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
		<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
		<p class="firstp">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Its most common application is to style web pages written in HTML and XHTML, but the language can also be applied to any kind of XML document.</p>
	<p>As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed</p>
		<p>Around 1995 the W3C was being established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board. By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.</p>
		<h2><strong>Use of CSS</strong></h2>
		<p><strong>Prior to CSS, nearly all of the presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup&mdash;all font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS allows authors to move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Prior to CSS, document authors who wanted to assign typographic characteristics had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and ma</strong>ny other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles such as the speed and emphasis with which text is read out by aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.</p>
        <div class="blockarea">
          <h1>Versions of CSS</h1>
          <h2>CSS 1</h2>
          <p>The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published in December 1996. The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.</p>
          <h2>CSS 2 &amp; CSS 2.1</h2>
          <p>CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.</p>
          <p>CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as &quot;CSS 2.1&quot;, fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already-implemented browser extensions to the specification. It was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.</p>
          <h2>CSS 3</h2>
  <p>Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called &quot;modules&quot;. Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2. As of June 2012, there are over fifty CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group, and four of these have been published as formal recommendations.</p>
        </div>
<h1>CSS Uses</h1>
		<h2>Content Separate From Appearance</h2>
		<p>You can create a CSS page about anything because it is a development tool that is disassociates content and appearance.  </p>
		<p>For instance, we can use a page with CSS to link to the images we created with photoshop since all Web pages should link somewhere.</p>

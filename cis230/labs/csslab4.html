You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.</p>

<p>The other nite, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms. When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken. And I hung my head and cried.</p>

<p>You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.</p>

<p>I'll always love you and make you happy, if you will only say the same. But if you leave me to love another, you'll regret it all some day.</p>

<p>You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.</p>

<p>You told me once, dear, you really loved me. And no one else could come between. But now you've left me and love another. You have shattered all my dreams</p>

<p>You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.</p>

<p>Louisiana, my Louisiana, the place where I was borne. White fields of cotton -- green fields clover, the best fishing and long tall corn.</p>

<p>You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.</p>

<p>Crawfish gumbo and jambalaya, the biggest shrimp and sugar cane, the finest oysters and sweet strawberries, from Toledo Bend to New Orleans.</p>

<p>You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.</p>
